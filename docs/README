risuai-electron: An electron port for RisuAI
============================================


Why does this port exist?
-------------------------

The official release[1] for desktop is implemented using Tauri. While
it might offer an acceptable experience on Windows and macOS, on Linux
the performance is often poor enough to hinder comfortable use. This
is primarily because it renders the UI with WebKitGTK, which is
significantly slower and less optimized than Chromium-based
engines. In addition, the official AppImage build does not bundle
WebKitGTK, requiring users to install it manually, and there have been
reports of libc version incompatibilities[2].

Other provided release formats have their own limitations. The Docker
build is optimized for web deployment and routes API calls through a
private Node.js proxy, which is slower than sending patches directly
from Electron’s built-in Node.js. It also suffers from filesystem
access overhead inherent to Docker, leading to noticeable bottlenecks
when opening long conversations. The web version hosted on risuai.xyz
proxies all HTTP requests through the project’s own server, yet the
proxy’s source code is not published despite the project’s GPL license
and open-source claims. In some cases, traffic is redirected to a Hong
Kong fallback server, which can cause failures with region-restricted
Gemini APIs.

This Electron port addresses these issues by bundling Chromium for
consistent performance, avoiding external proxies, and enabling
efficient local execution.
